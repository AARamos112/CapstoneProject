        <p class="card-text">HDS started as a remodeling effort by Emily and her husband Joe back in May 2007. They had contracted to do work for some family and friends that wanted to upgrade their existing homes (bathrooms and kitchens are their specialty). This included providing design work, and upgrades to kitchens and baths. </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Then a business </h5>
        <p class="card-text">Emily and Joe quickly determined that there was a tremendous need for this service in the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale, AZ area. They applied for a business license and opened Home Design Solutions as an LLC out of a small store location they rented at 101 Sedalia Drive, Phoenix, AZ 85001. </p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Then some more</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The first store location included some sample cabinets and appliances that they would later become regional distributors for. Both Joe and Emily became General Contractors in 2007 and all their bath and kitchen design specialists that have been hired since have acquired kitchen and bath design certifications. Since then they have opened 4 other locations. </p>
